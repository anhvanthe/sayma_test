- test the 2 ddr3 on sayma amc
- test drtio with the 2 sfp on sayma amc
- test amc rtm link (low level and wishbone)
- test spi jesd configuration with amc through amc rtm link (need m-labs support to generate csr for rtm in amc header?)
- test jesd with amc/rtm/wishbone bridge.
- create a misoc/migen design with everything integrated.

ddr3 tests:
- clk_p/clk_n generated correctly to ddr3 (oscillo ok)
- reset_n generated correctly to ddr3 (oscillo ok)
- init then no write/no read: dq12 not toggling.
- init then write data to ddr3: dq12 toggling --> fpga generates data
- init then read data to ddr3: dq12 toggling --> ddr3 generates data
- init then read data to ddr3 with pattern activated: dq12 toggling differently --> ddr3 seems
to recognize our commands.
--> we don't see read data on iserdese3/o_q, it seems something is wrong between io and output of iserdese3
